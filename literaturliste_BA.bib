	abstract = {In the 21st century ongoing rapid urbanization highlights the need to gain deeper insights into the social structure of cities. While work on this challenge can proﬁt from abundant data sources, the complexity of this data itself proves to be a challenge. In this paper we use diﬀusion maps, a manifold learning method, to discover hidden manifolds in the {UK} 2011 census dataset. The census key statistics and quick statistics report 1450 diﬀerent statistical features for each census output area. Here we focus primarily on the city of Bristol and the surrounding countryside, comprising 3490 of these output areas. Our analysis ﬁnds the main variables that span the census responses, highlighting that university student density and poverty are the most important explanatory variables of variation in census responses.},

	abstract = {Time-series studies of arctic marine ecosystems are rare. This is not surprising since polar regions are largely only accessible by means of expensive modern infrastructure and instrumentation. In 1999, the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz-Centre for Polar and Marine Research ({AWI}) established the {LTER} (Long-Term Ecological Research) observatory {HAUSGARTEN} crossing the Fram Strait at about 79◦ N. Multidisciplinary investigations covering all parts of the open-ocean ecosystem are carried out at a total of 21 permanent sampling sites in water depths ranging between 250 and 5500 m. From the outset, repeated sampling in the water column and at the deep seaﬂoor during regular expeditions in summer months was complemented by continuous year-round sampling and sensing using autonomous instruments in anchored devices (i.e., moorings and free-falling systems). The central {HAUSGARTEN} station at 2500 m water depth in the eastern Fram Strait serves as an experimental area for unique biological in situ experiments at the seaﬂoor, simulating various scenarios in changing environmental settings. Long-term ecological research at the {HAUSGARTEN} observatory revealed a number of interesting temporal trends in numerous biological variables from the pelagic system to the deep seaﬂoor. Contrary to common intuition, the entire ecosystem responded exceptionally fast to environmental changes in the upper water column. Major variations were associated with a Warm-Water-Anomaly evident in surface waters in eastern parts of the Fram Strait between 2005 and 2008. However, even after 15 years of intense time-series work at {HAUSGARTEN}, we cannot yet predict with complete certainty whether these trends indicate lasting alterations due to anthropologically-induced global environmental changes of the system, or whether they reﬂect natural variability on multiyear time-scales, for example, in relation to decadal oscillatory atmospheric processes.},

In this study, we used 454-pyrosequencing to study picoplankton communities at four stations in the West Spitsbergen Current ({WSC}; Fram Strait). High abundances of Micromonas pusilla were detected in the station situated closest to Spitsbergen, as seen in surveys of picoplankton assemblages in the Beaufort Sea. At the other three stations, other phylotypes, afﬁliating with Phaeocystis pouchetii and Syndiniales in the phylogenetic tree, were present in high numbers, dominating most of them. The picoplankton community structures at three of the stations, all with similar salinity and temperature, were alike. At the fourth station, the inﬂuence of the East Spitsbergen Current, transporting cold water from the Barents Sea around Spitsbergen, causes different abiotic parameters that result in a signiﬁcantly different picoeukaryote community composition, which is dominated by M. pusilla. This observation is particularly interesting with regard to ongoing environmental changes in the Arctic. Ongoing warming of the {WSC} could convey a new picoplankton assemblage into the Arctic Ocean, which may come to affect the dominance of M. pusilla.},

	abstract = {Between Greenland and Spitsbergen, Fram Strait is a region where cold icecovered Polar Water exits the Arctic Ocean with the East Greenland Current ({EGC}) and warm Atlantic Water enters the Arctic Ocean with the West Spitsbergen Current ({WSC}). In this compilation, we present two different data sets from plankton ecological observations in Fram Strait: (1) long-term measurements of satellite-derived (1998Á2012) and in situ chlorophyll a (chl a) measurements (mainly summer cruises, 1991Á2012) plus protist compositions (a station in {WSC}, eight summer cruises, 1998Á2011); and (2) short-term measurements of a multidisciplinary approach that includes traditional plankton investigations, remote sensing, zooplankton, microbiological and molecular studies, and biogeochemical analyses carried out during two expeditions in June/July in the years 2010 and 2011. Both summer satellite-derived and in situ chl a concentrations showed slight trends towards higher values in the {WSC} since 1998 and 1991, respectively. In contrast, no trends were visible in the {EGC}. The protist composition in the {WSC} showed differences for the summer months: a dominance of diatoms was replaced by a dominance of Phaeocystis pouchetii and other small pico- and nanoplankton species. The observed differences in eastern Fram Strait were partially due to a warm anomaly in the {WSC}. Although changes associated with warmer water temperatures were observed, further long-term investigations are needed to distinguish between natural variability and climate change in Fram Strait. Results of two summer studies in 2010 and 2011 revealed the variability in plankton ecology in Fram Strait.},

	abstract = {The Arctic Ocean plays a key role in regulating the global climate, while being highly sensitive to climate change. Temperature in the Arctic increases faster than the global average, causing a loss of multiyear sea-ice and affecting marine ecosystem structure and functioning. As a result, Arctic primary production and biogeochemical cycling are changing. Here, we investigated inter-annual changes in the concentrations of particulate and dissolved organic carbon ({POC}, {DOC}) together with biological drivers, such as phyto- and bacterioplankton abundance in the Fram Strait, the Atlantic gateway to the Central Arctic Ocean. Data have been collected in summer at the Long-Term Ecological Research observatory {HAUSGARTEN} during eight cruises from 2009 to 2017. Our results suggest that the dynamic physical system of the Fram Strait induces strong heterogeneity of the ecosystem that displays considerable intra-seasonal as well as inter-annual variability. Over the observational period, {DOC} concentrations were signiﬁcantly negatively related to temperature and salinity, suggesting that outﬂow of Central Arctic waters carrying a high {DOC} load is the main control of {DOC} concentration in this region. {POC} concentration was not linked to temperature or salinity but tightly related to phytoplankton biomass as estimated from chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chl-a). For the years 2009–2017, no temporal trends in the depth-integrated (0–100 m) amounts of {DOC} and Chl-a were observed. In contrast, depth-integrated (0–100 m) amounts of {POC}, as well as the ratio [{POC}]:[{TOC}], decreased signiﬁcantly over time. This suggests a higher partitioning of organic carbon into the dissolved phase. Potential causes and consequences of the observed changes in organic carbon stocks for food-web structure and {CO}2 sequestration are discussed.},

These areas roughly coincide with areas where ice concentration has decreased in early summer (June), thus making the earlier blooms possible. In the selected areas, the annual phytoplankton bloom maximum has advanced by up to 50 days which may have consequences for the Arctic food chain and carbon cycling. Outside the Arctic, the annual Chl maximum has become earlier in boreal North Paciﬁc but later in the North Atlantic.},

	abstract = {The Fram Strait is the main gateway for water, heat and sea-ice exchanges between the Arctic Ocean and the North Atlantic. The complex physical environment results in a highly variable primary production in space and time. Previous regional studies have deﬁned key bottom-up (ice cover and stratiﬁcation from melt water controlling the light availability, and wind mixing and water transport affecting the supply of nutrients) and top-down processes (heterotrophic grazing). In this study, in situ ﬁeld data, remote sensing and modeling techniques were combined to investigate in detail the inﬂuence of melting sea-ice and ocean properties on the development of phytoplankton blooms in the Fram Strait region for the years 1998–2009. Satellite-retrieved chlorophyll-a concentrations from temporarily ice-free zones were validated with contextual ﬁeld data. These were then integrated per month on a grid size of 20 × 20 km, resulting in 10 grids/ﬁelds. Factors tested for their inﬂuence on spatial and temporal variation of chlorophyll-a were: sea-ice concentration from satellite and sea-ice thickness, ocean stratiﬁcation, water temperature and salinity time-series simulated by the ice-ocean model {NAOSIM}. The time series analysis for those ten ice-free ﬁelds showed a regional separation according to different physical processes affecting phytoplankton distribution. At the marginal ice zone the melting sea-ice was promoting phytoplankton growth by stratifying the water column and potentially seeding phytoplankton communities. In this zone, the highest mean chlorophyll concentration averaged for the productive season (April–August) of 0.8 {mgC}/m3 was observed. In the open ocean the phytoplankton variability was correlated highest to stratiﬁcation formed by solar heating of the upper ocean layers. Coastal zone around Svalbard showed processes associated with the presence of coastal ice were rather suppressing than promoting the phytoplankton growth. During the twelve years of observations, chlorophyll concentrations signiﬁcantly increased in the southern part of the Fram Strait, associated with an increase in sea surface temperature and a decrease in Svalbard coastal ice.},

One key result of the classical molecular approaches, such as community fingerprints and environmental clone libraries, is that the bacterioplankton community contains only a few abundant species and a large number of less abundant to rare members. This is in contrast to soil bacterial communities, where no abundant species are detected and the total number of species is substantially larger. New approaches, such as metagenomics and pyrosequencing, are discussed in terms of their ability to determine the diversity and abundance of the rare members of the community and the biogeochemical potential of the community. Several new approaches, such as stable isotope probing ({SIP}) and multi-isotope imaging mass spectrometry ({MIMS}), have been developed to study structure–function relationships of microbial communities. The combination of biogeochemical stimulation experiments with these functional and/or molecular approaches has the potential to elucidate the role of specific microorganisms concerning specific biogeochemical functions. These experimental analyses, together with in situ measurements of molecular and biogeochemical markers, enable the identification of key catalysts of pelagic biogeochemical processes and determination of their regulatory factors. Based on our current understanding of the structure–function links in bacterioplankton, we hypothesize that any local bacterial community comprises 2 parts: the abundant members form a core community that carries out the ongoing biogeochemical functions, and the rare members form a seedbank that provides the genetic potential to respond to any change in the system. Together, both parts form a pan community that is able to mediate the biogeochemical processes in the pelagic ecosystems of the earth.},

Further, because these indices are based solely on presence–absence data, accurate estimators for them are unattainable. We provide a probabilistic derivation for the classic, incidence-based forms of these indices and extend this approach to formulate new Jaccard-type or Sørensen-type indices based on species abundance data. We then propose estimators for these indices that include the effect of unseen shared species, based on either (replicated) incidence- or abundancebased sample data. In sampling simulations, these new estimators prove to be considerably less biased than classic indices when a substantial proportion of species are missing from samples. Based on species-rich empirical datasets, we show how incorporating the effect of unseen shared species not only increases accuracy but also can change the interpretation of results.},

We consider how the interplay of these processes affects one biogeographic pattern, the distance–decay relationship, and review evidence from the published literature for the processes driving this pattern in microorganisms. Given the limitations of inferring processes from biogeographic patterns, we suggest that studies should focus on directly testing the underlying processes.},

This has been challenged during recent years by studies suggesting that also regional factors such as mass effect, dispersal limitation and neutral assembly are important for the composition of local bacterial communities. Here we summarize results from biogeography studies in different environments, i.e. in marine, freshwater and soil as well in human hosts. Species sorting appears to be the most important mechanism. However, this result might be biased since this is the mechanism that is easiest to measure, detect and interpret. Hence, the importance of regional factors may have been underestimated. Moreover, our survey indicates that different assembly mechanisms might be important for different parts of the total community, differing, for example, between generalists and specialists, and between taxa of different dispersal ability and motility. We conclude that there is a clear need for experimental studies, ﬁrst, to clearly separate regional and local factors in order to study their relative importance, and second, to test whether there are differences in assembly mechanisms depending on different taxonomic or functional groups.},

To challenge this view, marine bacterioplankton communities from coastal waters at nine locations distributed world-wide were examined through the use of comprehensive clone libraries of 16S ribosomal {RNA} genes, used as operational taxonomic units ({OTU}). Our survey and analyses show that there were marked differences in the composition and richness of {OTUs} between locations. Remarkably, the global marine bacterioplankton community showed a high degree of endemism, and conversely included few cosmopolitan {OTUs}. Our data were consistent with a latitudinal gradient of {OTU} richness. We observed a positive relationship between the relative {OTU} abundances and their range of occupation, i.e. cosmopolitans had the largest population sizes. Although {OTU} richness differed among locations, the distributions of the major taxonomic groups represented in the communities were analogous, and all local communities were similarly structured and dominated by a few {OTUs} showing variable taxonomic affiliations. The observed patterns of {OTU} richness indicate that similar evolutionary and ecological processes structured the communities. We conclude that marine bacterioplankton share many of the biogeographical and macroecological features of macroscopic organisms. The general processes behind those patterns are likely to be comparable across taxa and major global biomes.},

Bacterial operational taxonomic units ({OTUs}), generated by denaturing-gradient gel electrophoresis of polymerase chain-reactionampliﬁed 16S {rRNA} genes, were used as a surrogate of predominant ‘‘biodiversity units.’’ {OTU} composition among lakes was heterogeneous, and the number of site-speciﬁc {OTUs} was near 50\%. Lake remoteness did not affect the number of bacterial {OTUs} although the spatial distribution of the lakes signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced bacterial composition. Lakes that were closer together had more similar bacterial ﬁngerprints. We found a consistent positive association between bacterial {OTU} richness and lake area. The slope of this relationship (0.161 Ϯ 0.026, including literature data) was similar to slopes obtained for organisms with high dispersion rates.},

The richness of members of the Cytophaga-Flavobacteria-Bacteroides group exhibited a signiﬁcant hump-shaped relationship with productivity, as is often observed for plant and animal richness in aquatic systems. In contrast, we observed a signiﬁcant U-shaped relationship between richness and productivity for a-proteobacteria and no discernable relationship for b-proteobacteria. We show, for the first time, that bacterial diversity varies along a gradient of primary productivity and thus make an important step towards understanding processes responsible for the maintenance of bacterial biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Climate models project that the Arctic Ocean may experience ice-free summers by the second half of this century. This may have severe repercussions on phytoplankton bloom dynamics and the associated cycling of carbon in surface waters. We currently lack baseline knowledge of the seasonal dynamics of Arctic microbial communities, which is needed in order to better estimate the effects of such changes on ecosystem functioning. Here we present a comparative study of polar summer microbial communities in the ice-free (eastern) and ice-covered (western) hydrographic regimes at the {LTER} {HAUSGARTEN} in Fram Strait, the main gateway between the Arctic and North Atlantic Oceans. Based on measured and modeled biogeochemical parameters, we tentatively identiﬁed two different ecosystem states (i.e., different phytoplankton bloom stages) in the distinct regions. Using Illumina tag-sequencing, we determined the community composition of both free-living and particle-associated bacteria as well as microbial eukaryotes in the photic layer. Despite substantial horizontal mixing by eddies in Fram Strait, pelagic microbial communities showed distinct differences between the two regimes, with a proposed early spring (pre-bloom) community in the ice-covered western regime (with higher representation of {SAR}11, {SAR}202, {SAR}406 and eukaryotic {MALVs}) and a community indicative of late summer conditions (post-bloom) in the icefree eastern regime (with higher representation of Flavobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and eukaryotic heterotrophs). Co-occurrence networks revealed speciﬁc taxon-taxon associations between bacterial and eukaryotic taxa in the two regions. Our results suggest that the predicted changes in sea ice cover and phytoplankton bloom dynamics will have a strong impact on bacterial community dynamics and potentially on biogeochemical cycles in this region.},

However, many investigators are either unaware of this or assume speciﬁc properties of the compositional data. The purpose of this review is to alert investigators to the dangers inherent in ignoring the compositional nature of the data, and point out that {HTS} datasets derived from microbiome studies can and should be treated as compositions at all stages of analysis.

To address this, we tested whether the mechanisms that underlie bacterial temporal b-diversity vary across different scales in three marine microbial communities. While seasonal turnover was detected, at least 73\% of the community variation occurred at intra-seasonal temporal scales, suggesting that episodic events are important in structuring marine microbial communities. In addition, turnover at different temporal scales appeared to be driven by different factors. Intra-seasonal turnover was signiﬁcantly correlated to environmental variables such as phosphate and silicate concentrations, while seasonal and interannual turnover were related to nitrate concentration and temporal distance. We observed a strong link between the magnitude of environmental variation and bacterial b-diversity in different communities. Analogous to spatial biogeography, we found different rates of community changes across temporal scales.},

	abstract = {Current practice in the normalization of microbiome count data is inefficient in the statistical sense. For apparently historical reasons, the common approach is either to use simple proportions (which does not address heteroscedasticity) or to use rarefying of counts, even though both of these approaches are inappropriate for detection of differentially abundant species. Well-established statistical theory is available that simultaneously accounts for library size differences and biological variability using an appropriate mixture model. Moreover, specific implementations for {DNA} sequencing read count data (based on a Negative Binomial model for instance) are already available in {RNA}-Seq focused R packages such as {edgeR} and {DESeq}. Here we summarize the supporting statistical theory and use simulations and empirical data to demonstrate substantial improvements provided by a relevant mixture model framework over simple proportions or rarefying. We show how both proportions and rarefied counts result in a high rate of false positives in tests for species that are differentially abundant across sample classes. Regarding microbiome sample-wise clustering, we also show that the rarefying procedure often discards samples that can be accurately clustered by alternative methods. We further compare different Negative Binomial methods with a recently-described zero-inflated Gaussian mixture, implemented in a package called {metagenomeSeq}. We find that {metagenomeSeq} performs well when there is an adequate number of biological replicates, but it nevertheless tends toward a higher false positive rate. Based on these results and well-established statistical theory, we advocate that investigators avoid rarefying altogether. We have provided microbiome-specific extensions to these tools in the R package, phyloseq.},

In both cases, spatial structuring plays a functional role in ecosystems. Ecological models should explicitly take into account the spatial structure of ecosystems. In previous work, we used a polynomial function of the geographic coordinates of the sampling sites to model broad-scale spatial variation in a canonical (regression-type) modelling context. In this paper, we propose a method for detecting and quantifying spatial patterns over a wide range of scales. This is obtained by eigenvalue decomposition of a truncated matrix of geographic distances among the sampling sites. The eigenvectors corresponding to positive eigenvalues are used as spatial descriptors in regression or canonical analysis. This method can be applied to any set of sites providing a good coverage of the geographic sampling area. This paper investigates the behaviour of the method using numerical simulations and an artiﬁcial pseudo-ecological data set of known properties. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Summary: Diffusion maps are a spectral method for non-linear dimension reduction and have recently been adapted for the visualization of single-cell expression data. Here we present destiny, an efﬁcient R implementation of the diffusion map algorithm. Our package includes a single-cell speciﬁc noise model allowing for missing and censored values. In contrast to previous implementations, we further present an efﬁcient nearest-neighbour approximation that allows for the processing of hundreds of thousands of cells and a functionality for projecting new data on existing diffusion maps. We exemplarily apply destiny to a recent time-resolved mass cytometry dataset of cellular reprogramming.},

	abstract = {The water mass distribution in northern Fram Strait and over the Yermak Plateau in summer 1997 is described using {CTD} data from two cruises in the area. The West Spitsbergen Current was found to split, one part recirculated towards the west, while the other part, on entering the Arctic Ocean separated into two branches. The main inflow of Atlantic Water followed the Svalbard continental slope eastward, while a second, narrower, branch stayed west and north of the Yermak Plateau. The water column above the southeastern flank of the Yermak Plateau was distinctly colder and less saline than the two inflow branches. Immediately west of the outer inflow branch comparatively high temperatures in the Atlantic Layer suggested that a part of the extraordinarily warm Atlantic Water, observed in the boundary current in the Eurasian Basin in the early 1990s, was now returning, within the Eurasian Basin, toward Fram Strait. The upper layer west of the Yermak Plateau was cold, deep and comparably saline, similar to what has recently been observed in the interior Eurasian Basin. Closer to the Greenland continental slope the salinity of the upper layer became much lower, and the temperature maximum of the Atlantic Layer was occasionally below 0.5 °C, indicating water masses mainly derived from the Canadian Basin. This implies that the warm pulse of Atlantic Water had not yet made a complete circuit around the Arctic Ocean. The Atlantic Water of the West Spitsbergen Current recirculating within the strait did not extend as far towards Greenland as in the 1980s, leaving a broader passage for waters from the Atlantic and intermediate layers, exiting the Arctic Ocean. A possible interpretation is that the circulation pattern alternates between a strong recirculation of the West Spitsbergen Current in the strait, and a larger exchange of Atlantic Water between the Nordic Seas and the inner parts of the Arctic Ocean.},

	abstract = {Our ability to understand the complex interactions of biological, chemical, physical, and geological processes in the ocean and on land is still limited by the lack of integrative and interdisciplinary observation infrastructures. The main purpose of the planned open-ocean infrastructure {FRAM} ({FRontiers} in Arctic marine Monitoring) is permanent presence at sea, from surface to depth, for the provision of near real-time data on climate variability and ecosystem change in a marine Arctic system. The Alfred-Wegener-Institut – Helmholtz-Zentrum für Polar- und Meeresforschung ({AWI}), together with partner institutes in Germany and Europe, aims at providing such infrastructure for the polar ocean as a major contribution to the grand challenges of Earth observation and environmental status. The {FRAM} Ocean Observing System targets the gateway between the North Atlantic and the Central Arctic, representing a highly climate-sensitive and rapidly changing region of the Earth system. It will serve national and international tasks towards a better understanding of the effects of change in ocean circulation, water mass properties and sea-ice retreat on Arctic marine ecosystems and their main functions and services. {FRAM} will implement existing and nextgeneration sensors and observatory platforms, allowing synchronous observation of relevant ocean variables, as well as the study of physical, chemical and biological processes in the water column and at the seafloor. Experimental and event-triggered platforms will complement observational platforms. Products of the infrastructure are continuous long-term data with appropriate resolution in space and time, as well as ground-truthing information for ocean models and remote sensing. {FRAM} will integrate and develop already existing observatories, i.e. the oceanographic mooring array {HAFOS} (Hybrid Arctic/Antarctic Float Observing System) and the Long-Term Ecological Research ({LTER}) site {HAUSGARTEN}.},

A new time series constructed from in situ measurements of sea ice thickness at the end of the melt season in Fram Strait shows a thinning by over 50\% during 2003?2012. The modal and mean ice thickness along 79°N decreased at a rate of 0.3 and 0.2?m?yr?1, respectively, with long-term averages of 2.5 and 3 m. Airborne observations reveal an east-west thickness gradient across the strait in spring but not in summer due to advection from more different source regions. There is no clear relationship between interannual ice thickness variability and the source regions of the ice. The observed thinning is therefore likely a result of Arctic-wide reduction in ice thickness with a potential shift in exported ice types playing a minor role.},

Time series also enlarge our understanding of ecological processes and are integral for improving models of physicalbiogeochemical-ecological ocean dynamics. The major time-series observatories go well beyond simple monitoring of core ocean properties, although that important activity forms the critical center of all time-series efforts.

	abstract = {As part of the {HAUSGARTEN} long-term observatory, sediment trap deployments were carried out before, during, and after the anomalously warm Atlantic Water inflow observed from 2005 to 2007 in the eastern Fram Strait. Downward export of particulate organic carbon ({POC}), zooplankton fecal pellet carbon ({FPC}), and biogenic particulate silica ({bPSi}) were measured from August 2002 to June 2003 and from July 2004 to July 2008 to indirectly assess the impact of the warm anomaly on phytoplankton and zooplankton communities in the region. Lower and less frequent {bPSi} fluxes were observed during most of the warm anomaly period, reflecting a shift in phytoplankton community composition towards dominance of small-sized phytoplankton under warmer conditions. Lower {FPC} fluxes observed concurrently with the lower {bPSi} fluxes may indicate a decrease in fecal pellet production due to changing feeding conditions. In addition, the export of smaller fecal pellets in fall 2005 and spring 2006 suggests a dominance of smaller zooplankton during the warm anomaly. Nonetheless, {bPSi} and {FPC} export always increased in the presence of ice cover in the area above the sediment trap, even during the warm anomaly period, suggesting that sea ice is a key factor influencing the frequency of export events in the eastern Fram Strait. The scarcity of ice over the sampling area in 2005 and 2006 may partly be due to the warm anomaly, although solar radiation and ice drift due to wind stress also govern ice cover extent in the region. Overall, the warm anomaly resulted in a shift in the composition of the export fluxes when associated with an absence of ice cover in the eastern Fram Strait.},

	abstract = {Since 2000 long-term measurements of vertical particle flux have been performed with moored sediment traps at the long-term observatory {HAUSGARTEN} in the eastern Fram Strait (79°N/4°E). The study area, which is seasonally covered with ice, is located in the confluence zone of the northward flowing warm saline Atlantic water with cold, low salinity water masses of Arctic origin. Current projections suggest that this area is particularly vulnerable to global warming. Total matter fluxes and components thereof (carbonate, particulate organic carbon and nitrogen, biogenic silica, biomarkers) revealed a bimodal seasonal pattern showing elevated sedimentation rates during May/June and August/September. Annual total matter flux (dry weight, {DW}) at ∼300m depth varied between 13 and 32gm−2a−1 during 2000 and 2005. Of this total flux 6–13\% was due to {CaCO}3, 4–21\% to refractory particulate organic carbon ({POC}), and 3–8\% to biogenic particulate silica ({bPSi}). The annual flux of all biogenic components together was almost constant during the period studied (8.5–8.8gm−2a−1), although this varied from 27\% to 67\% of the total annual flux. The fraction was lowest in a year characterized by the longest duration of ice coverage (91 and 70 days for the calendar year and summer season, May–September, respectively). Biomarker analyses revealed that organic matter originating from marine sources was present in excess of terrigenious material in the sedimented matter throughout most of the study period. Fluxes of recognizable phyto- and protozooplankton cells amounted up to 60×106m−2d−1. Diatoms and coccolithophorids were the most abundant organisms. Diatoms, mainly pennate species, dominated during the first years of the investigation. A shift in the composition occurred during the last year when numbers of diatoms declined considerably, leading to a dominance of coccolithoporids. This was also reflected in a decrease in the sedimentation of {bPSi}. The sedimentation of biogenic matter, however, did not differ from the amount observed during the previous years. Among the larger organisms, pteropods at times contributed significantly to both the total matter and {CaCO}3, fluxes.},

	abstract = {The lack of extended dataset has so far prevented an inclusive understanding of the long-term relationships between primary production ({PP}) and vertical export in the Arctic Ocean. It is urgent to investigate these connections as Arctic ecosystems are on the verge of climate-related shifts, which could be caused by the combined effects of increase in Pacific and Atlantic inflow, climate warming, and sea ice decline. For a period of 6 years we investigated the degree of coupling between {PP} and export by making use of modelled {PP} rates and vertical particle fluxes collected with sediment traps moored at {\textasciitilde}300 m depth in the eastern Fram Strait. Our analyses indicate that total and new simulated {PP} averaged for different areas centered on the mooring location (5–200 km radius) explain at best 20–44\% of the observed biogenic particle fluxes at 300 m, when applying extended time-lags (55–90 days) between {PP} and vertical fluxes. Based on this phasing, we define a conceptual framework that presents the temporal dimension as a prime determinant of the maximum strength of the {PP}-export coupling at a given depth. Our results support that planktonic food webs in the Fram Strait process heavily biogenic material in the epipelagic zone, but we further suggest that Atlantic-Arctic water interactions induce a particular ecological setting responsible for the extended turn-over. In conclusion, we hypothesize that global warming could promote a transition toward a more retentive ecosystem in the Fram Strait region despite the likely increase of pelagic {PP} in the Arctic Ocean.},

Using over three decades of continuous satellite observations, we show that increased inflow and temperature of Atlantic waters in the Barents Sea resulted in a striking poleward shift in the distribution of blooms of Emiliania huxleyi, a marine calcifying phytoplankton species. This species’ blooms are typically associated with temperate waters and have expanded north to 76°N, five degrees further north of its first bloom occurrence in 1989. E. huxleyi’s blooms keep pace with the changing climate of the Barents Sea, namely ocean warming and shifts in the position of the Polar Front, resulting in an exceptionally rapid range shift compared to what is generally detected in the marine realm. We propose that as the Eurasian Basin of the Arctic Ocean further atlantifies and ocean temperatures continue to rise, E. huxleyi and other temperate-origin phytoplankton could well become resident bloom formers in the Arctic Ocean.},

	abstract = {Eastern Fram Strait and the shelf slope region north of Svalbard is dominated by the advection of warm, salty and nutrient-rich Atlantic Water ({AW}). This oceanic heat contributes to keeping the area relatively free of ice. The last years have seen a dramatic decrease in regional sea ice extent, which is expected to drive large increases in pelagic primary production and thereby changes in marine ecology and nutrient cycling. In a concerted effort, we conducted ﬁve cruises to the area in winter, spring, summer and fall of 2014, in order to understand the physical and biogeochemical controls of carbon cycling, for the ﬁrst time from a year-round point of view. We document (1) the offshore location of the wintertime front between salty {AW} and fresher Surface Water in the ocean surface, (2) thermal convection of Atlantic Water over the shelf slope, likely enhancing vertical nutrient ﬂuxes, and (3) the importance of ice melt derived upper ocean stratiﬁcation for the spring bloom timing. Our ﬁndings strongly conﬁrm the hypothesis that this “Atlantiﬁcation,” as it has been called, of the shelf slope area north of Svalbard resulting from the advection of {AW} alleviates both nutrient and light limitations at the same time, leading to increased pelagic primary productivity in this region.},

Here we present an analysis of the current distribution of Mytilus spp. on Svalbard, with a focus on the west coast of Spitsbergen where strong Atlantification has been documented over the last few decades. We conducted diver-based surveys to develop a distributional map and to compare the current distribution with that of the Holocene. Furthermore, we investigate the recent history of recruitment of mussels on Svalbard to help identify invasion pathways. Our results show that blue mussels have been present on the archipelago at least since 2000 and are widespread along the west coast today. We also present evidence of local reproduction in one of the sites explored.},

	abstract = {Present-day Mediterranean marine biodiversity is undergoing rapid alteration. Because of the increased occurrence of warm-water biota, it has been said that the Mediterranean is under a process of ‘tropicalization’. This paper analyses the main patterns of the Mediterranean Sea tropicalization and considers briefly its extent and consequences. As happened during previous interglacial phases of the Quaternary, Atlantic water, entering via the Straits of Gibraltar, carries into the Mediterranean species that are prevalently of (sub)tropical affinity. On the other side of the basin, Red Sea species penetrate through the Suez Canal, a phenomenon called lessepsian migration from the name of F. de Lesseps, the French engineer who promoted the cutting of the Canal. Also the many exotic species introduced by humans voluntarily or involuntarily are nearly always typical of warm waters. Climate change combines with Atlantic influx, lessepsian migration and the introduction of exotic species by humans to the establishment of tropical marine biota in the Mediterranean Sea. Present-day warming ultimately favours the spread of warm-water species through direct and indirect effects, and especially by changing water circulation. It is impossible at present to foresee to what extent the exuberance of warm-water species will affect the trophic web and the functioning of marine ecosystems in the Mediterranean Sea of tomorrow. While Mediterranean Sea communities are modifying their pattern of species composition, they do not seem to be acquiring a more marked tropical physiognomy: Mediterranean coastal marine ecosystems are still dominated by frondose algae (even if the species that are gaining ascendancy are of tropical origin) and not by corals as is normal in tropical seas.},

	abstract = {Climate-driven changes in biotic interactions can profoundly alter ecological communities, particularly when they impact foundation species. In marine systems, changes in herbivory and the consequent loss of dominant habitat forming species can result in dramatic community phase shifts, such as from coral to macroalgal dominance when tropical fish herbivory decreases, and from algal forests to ‘barrens’ when temperate urchin grazing increases. Here, we propose a novel phase-shift away from macroalgal dominance caused by tropical herbivores extending their range into temperate regions. We argue that this phase shift is facilitated by poleward-flowing boundary currents that are creating ocean warming hotspots around the globe, enabling the range expansion of tropical species and increasing their grazing rates in temperate areas. Overgrazing of temperate macroalgae by tropical herbivorous fishes has already occurred in Japan and the Mediterranean. Emerging evidence suggests similar phenomena are occurring in other temperate regions, with increasing occurrence of tropical fishes on temperate reefs.},

The impacts of anthropogenic climate change so far include decreased ocean productivity, altered food web dynamics, reduced abundance of habitat-forming species, shifting species distributions, and a greater incidence of disease.

Our projections show that climate change may lead to numerous local extinction in the sub-polar regions, the tropics and semi-enclosed seas. Simultaneously, species invasion is projected to be most intense in the Arctic and the Southern Ocean. Together, they result in dramatic species turnovers of over 60\% of the present biodiversity, implying ecological disturbances that potentially disrupt ecosystem services.
