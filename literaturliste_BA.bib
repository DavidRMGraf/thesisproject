	abstract = {In the 21st century ongoing rapid urbanization highlights the need to gain deeper insights into the social structure of cities. While work on this challenge can proﬁt from abundant data sources, the complexity of this data itself proves to be a challenge. In this paper we use diﬀusion maps, a manifold learning method, to discover hidden manifolds in the {UK} 2011 census dataset. The census key statistics and quick statistics report 1450 diﬀerent statistical features for each census output area. Here we focus primarily on the city of Bristol and the surrounding countryside, comprising 3490 of these output areas. Our analysis ﬁnds the main variables that span the census responses, highlighting that university student density and poverty are the most important explanatory variables of variation in census responses.},

	abstract = {Time-series studies of arctic marine ecosystems are rare. This is not surprising since polar regions are largely only accessible by means of expensive modern infrastructure and instrumentation. In 1999, the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz-Centre for Polar and Marine Research ({AWI}) established the {LTER} (Long-Term Ecological Research) observatory {HAUSGARTEN} crossing the Fram Strait at about 79◦ N. Multidisciplinary investigations covering all parts of the open-ocean ecosystem are carried out at a total of 21 permanent sampling sites in water depths ranging between 250 and 5500 m. From the outset, repeated sampling in the water column and at the deep seaﬂoor during regular expeditions in summer months was complemented by continuous year-round sampling and sensing using autonomous instruments in anchored devices (i.e., moorings and free-falling systems). The central {HAUSGARTEN} station at 2500 m water depth in the eastern Fram Strait serves as an experimental area for unique biological in situ experiments at the seaﬂoor, simulating various scenarios in changing environmental settings. Long-term ecological research at the {HAUSGARTEN} observatory revealed a number of interesting temporal trends in numerous biological variables from the pelagic system to the deep seaﬂoor. Contrary to common intuition, the entire ecosystem responded exceptionally fast to environmental changes in the upper water column. Major variations were associated with a Warm-Water-Anomaly evident in surface waters in eastern parts of the Fram Strait between 2005 and 2008. However, even after 15 years of intense time-series work at {HAUSGARTEN}, we cannot yet predict with complete certainty whether these trends indicate lasting alterations due to anthropologically-induced global environmental changes of the system, or whether they reﬂect natural variability on multiyear time-scales, for example, in relation to decadal oscillatory atmospheric processes.},

In this study, we used 454-pyrosequencing to study picoplankton communities at four stations in the West Spitsbergen Current ({WSC}; Fram Strait). High abundances of Micromonas pusilla were detected in the station situated closest to Spitsbergen, as seen in surveys of picoplankton assemblages in the Beaufort Sea. At the other three stations, other phylotypes, afﬁliating with Phaeocystis pouchetii and Syndiniales in the phylogenetic tree, were present in high numbers, dominating most of them. The picoplankton community structures at three of the stations, all with similar salinity and temperature, were alike. At the fourth station, the inﬂuence of the East Spitsbergen Current, transporting cold water from the Barents Sea around Spitsbergen, causes different abiotic parameters that result in a signiﬁcantly different picoeukaryote community composition, which is dominated by M. pusilla. This observation is particularly interesting with regard to ongoing environmental changes in the Arctic. Ongoing warming of the {WSC} could convey a new picoplankton assemblage into the Arctic Ocean, which may come to affect the dominance of M. pusilla.},

	abstract = {Between Greenland and Spitsbergen, Fram Strait is a region where cold icecovered Polar Water exits the Arctic Ocean with the East Greenland Current ({EGC}) and warm Atlantic Water enters the Arctic Ocean with the West Spitsbergen Current ({WSC}). In this compilation, we present two different data sets from plankton ecological observations in Fram Strait: (1) long-term measurements of satellite-derived (1998Á2012) and in situ chlorophyll a (chl a) measurements (mainly summer cruises, 1991Á2012) plus protist compositions (a station in {WSC}, eight summer cruises, 1998Á2011); and (2) short-term measurements of a multidisciplinary approach that includes traditional plankton investigations, remote sensing, zooplankton, microbiological and molecular studies, and biogeochemical analyses carried out during two expeditions in June/July in the years 2010 and 2011. Both summer satellite-derived and in situ chl a concentrations showed slight trends towards higher values in the {WSC} since 1998 and 1991, respectively. In contrast, no trends were visible in the {EGC}. The protist composition in the {WSC} showed differences for the summer months: a dominance of diatoms was replaced by a dominance of Phaeocystis pouchetii and other small pico- and nanoplankton species. The observed differences in eastern Fram Strait were partially due to a warm anomaly in the {WSC}. Although changes associated with warmer water temperatures were observed, further long-term investigations are needed to distinguish between natural variability and climate change in Fram Strait. Results of two summer studies in 2010 and 2011 revealed the variability in plankton ecology in Fram Strait.},

	abstract = {The Arctic Ocean plays a key role in regulating the global climate, while being highly sensitive to climate change. Temperature in the Arctic increases faster than the global average, causing a loss of multiyear sea-ice and affecting marine ecosystem structure and functioning. As a result, Arctic primary production and biogeochemical cycling are changing. Here, we investigated inter-annual changes in the concentrations of particulate and dissolved organic carbon ({POC}, {DOC}) together with biological drivers, such as phyto- and bacterioplankton abundance in the Fram Strait, the Atlantic gateway to the Central Arctic Ocean. Data have been collected in summer at the Long-Term Ecological Research observatory {HAUSGARTEN} during eight cruises from 2009 to 2017. Our results suggest that the dynamic physical system of the Fram Strait induces strong heterogeneity of the ecosystem that displays considerable intra-seasonal as well as inter-annual variability. Over the observational period, {DOC} concentrations were signiﬁcantly negatively related to temperature and salinity, suggesting that outﬂow of Central Arctic waters carrying a high {DOC} load is the main control of {DOC} concentration in this region. {POC} concentration was not linked to temperature or salinity but tightly related to phytoplankton biomass as estimated from chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chl-a). For the years 2009–2017, no temporal trends in the depth-integrated (0–100 m) amounts of {DOC} and Chl-a were observed. In contrast, depth-integrated (0–100 m) amounts of {POC}, as well as the ratio [{POC}]:[{TOC}], decreased signiﬁcantly over time. This suggests a higher partitioning of organic carbon into the dissolved phase. Potential causes and consequences of the observed changes in organic carbon stocks for food-web structure and {CO}2 sequestration are discussed.},

These areas roughly coincide with areas where ice concentration has decreased in early summer (June), thus making the earlier blooms possible. In the selected areas, the annual phytoplankton bloom maximum has advanced by up to 50 days which may have consequences for the Arctic food chain and carbon cycling. Outside the Arctic, the annual Chl maximum has become earlier in boreal North Paciﬁc but later in the North Atlantic.},

	abstract = {The Fram Strait is the main gateway for water, heat and sea-ice exchanges between the Arctic Ocean and the North Atlantic. The complex physical environment results in a highly variable primary production in space and time. Previous regional studies have deﬁned key bottom-up (ice cover and stratiﬁcation from melt water controlling the light availability, and wind mixing and water transport affecting the supply of nutrients) and top-down processes (heterotrophic grazing). In this study, in situ ﬁeld data, remote sensing and modeling techniques were combined to investigate in detail the inﬂuence of melting sea-ice and ocean properties on the development of phytoplankton blooms in the Fram Strait region for the years 1998–2009. Satellite-retrieved chlorophyll-a concentrations from temporarily ice-free zones were validated with contextual ﬁeld data. These were then integrated per month on a grid size of 20 × 20 km, resulting in 10 grids/ﬁelds. Factors tested for their inﬂuence on spatial and temporal variation of chlorophyll-a were: sea-ice concentration from satellite and sea-ice thickness, ocean stratiﬁcation, water temperature and salinity time-series simulated by the ice-ocean model {NAOSIM}. The time series analysis for those ten ice-free ﬁelds showed a regional separation according to different physical processes affecting phytoplankton distribution. At the marginal ice zone the melting sea-ice was promoting phytoplankton growth by stratifying the water column and potentially seeding phytoplankton communities. In this zone, the highest mean chlorophyll concentration averaged for the productive season (April–August) of 0.8 {mgC}/m3 was observed. In the open ocean the phytoplankton variability was correlated highest to stratiﬁcation formed by solar heating of the upper ocean layers. Coastal zone around Svalbard showed processes associated with the presence of coastal ice were rather suppressing than promoting the phytoplankton growth. During the twelve years of observations, chlorophyll concentrations signiﬁcantly increased in the southern part of the Fram Strait, associated with an increase in sea surface temperature and a decrease in Svalbard coastal ice.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we focus on the current understanding of the microbial diversity of bacterioplankton and its link to the biogeochemistry of the pelagic zone of aquatic ecosystems. During the last 2 decades, a large array of molecular approaches has been developed and applied to assess the diversity of bacterioplankton. One key result of the classical molecular approaches, such as community fingerprints and environmental clone libraries, is that the bacterioplankton community contains only a few abundant species and a large number of less abundant to rare members. This is in contrast to soil bacterial communities, where no abundant species are detected and the total number of species is substantially larger. New approaches, such as metagenomics and pyrosequencing, are discussed in terms of their ability to determine the diversity and abundance of the rare members of the community and the biogeochemical potential of the community. Several new approaches, such as stable isotope probing ({SIP}) and multi-isotope imaging mass spectrometry ({MIMS}), have been developed to study structure–function relationships of microbial communities. The combination of biogeochemical stimulation experiments with these functional and/or molecular approaches has the potential to elucidate the role of specific microorganisms concerning specific biogeochemical functions. These experimental analyses, together with in situ measurements of molecular and biogeochemical markers, enable the identification of key catalysts of pelagic biogeochemical processes and determination of their regulatory factors. Based on our current understanding of the structure–function links in bacterioplankton, we hypothesize that any local bacterial community comprises 2 parts: the abundant members form a core community that carries out the ongoing biogeochemical functions, and the rare members form a seedbank that provides the genetic potential to respond to any change in the system. Together, both parts form a pan community that is able to mediate the biogeochemical processes in the pelagic ecosystems of the earth.},

We show that eigenfunctions of Markov matrices can be used to construct coordinates called diffusion maps that generate efﬁcient representations of complex geometric structures. The associated family of diffusion distances, obtained by iterating the Markov matrix, deﬁnes multiscale geometries that prove to be useful in the context of data parametrization and dimensionality reduction. The proposed framework relates the spectral properties of Markov processes to their geometric counterparts and it uniﬁes ideas arising in a variety of contexts such as machine learning, spectral graph theory and eigenmap methods.},
